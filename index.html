            <p>Ever wish life had the same logical flow as code? Me too. While emotions make life messy, coding gives me a way to solve problems—logically, efficiently, and (hopefully) bug-free!</p>

            <p>I'm a Software Developer, fascinated by web dev & Gen AI. I believe in delivering perfection, not just meeting deadlines. 
                My tech stack? Python, AWS & Power Automate and UI path. (can't avoid DSA) </p>

            <p>When I code, I start from the end-user’s perspective. After all, what’s the point of great code if no one finds it useful?</p>

            <p>At the end of the day, I just want to see my work out in the real world, making life a little easier.</p>
